## About
This quiz uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test your (and my) basic coding knowledge. This quiz uses a timer for the score. You have sixty seconds to finish the quiz, but with every incorrect answer you lose ten seconds. However many seconds left on the timer at the end of the quiz is your score. You can then input your initials and score on the High Score page.
